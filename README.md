### Heya!

I am a young game developer who makes short, gameplay-focused games. Here on Github you can find the source code for some of my games.

You can find all my released games on my [itch page](https://howdoesonename.itch.io/sonic-runner).

### What I know

As of 2024, I have been using Godot game engine for 4 years. Most of my games are made in Godot.

I have been learning C, C++, C# in school, and have been trying out Raylib in my free time.

### What I am up to

Currently, i am trying to finish a lot of my projects so i can move on and make new ones.

Unfortunately, i am doing a bad job :P
