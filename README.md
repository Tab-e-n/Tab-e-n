### Hiya!

I am a game developer who makes somewhat short, gameplay-focused games.
Here on Github you can find the source codes of some of my games,
where I felt showing it was warranted.

You can find all my released games on my [itch page](https://howdoesonename.itch.io).

### What I know

As of 2025, I have been using Godot game engine for 5 years.
I also make games using Raylib.

I have experience using C and Python.

### What I am up to

Studying... mostly...
