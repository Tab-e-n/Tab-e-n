### Heya!

I am a young game developer who makes short, gameplay-focused games. Here on Github you can find the source code for some of my games.

You can find all my released games on my [itch page](https://howdoesonename.itch.io).

### What I know

As of 2024, I have been using Godot game engine for 4 years. Most of my games are made in Godot,
but i have been trying out Raylib in my free time.

I have learnt C, C++, C# and Python.

### What I am up to

Currently, i am trying to finish a lot of my projects so i can move on and make new ones.

Unfortunately, i am doing a bad job :P
